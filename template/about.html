<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Ardhi security is an initiative that was birthed from a hackerthon that was organized by Nem group when they trained the developers at Swahilibox on blockchain integration technology.</p>
<p>Ardhi Security is a brain child of Isaac Nyakoi.He coinded the name Ardhi Security which simply means Land security.The idea behind this was to curb the land scandals that have become a nightmare to most land owners in Kenya.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it is the right of every Kenyan citizen to have land ownership as long as he/she acquired the land legitimately. It is no longer safe as a land owner to be assured of your legitimacy in Kenya. This is because of so many fraudulent land dealers who parade themselves as genuine land owners and ultimately end up conning the unsuspecting naive public. It is most unfortunate that most of these quacks who parade themselves as genuine land agents are actually working in the ministry of land or aliased with the land agents who ought to actually protect their clients.</p>
<p>Despite having unscrupulous land owners some land agents even go ahead to lure desperate clients to purchase illegal land which is either public land or riparian land. Now that issue ought to be sorted out at the ministry of land before the transactions are even made. Ardhi Security will keep records of every land transaction and thus anyone who tries to sell illegal land will be traced without much effort. Moreover, every land owner will have an account with Ardhi security which will be full proof because it is intergrated with blockchain technology making it impossible to not only hack but also to alter or forge the ownership. This will keep the footprints of any transactions made on this platform and will therefore automatically barr any unwanted land dealers. The land owners will keep track of their lands and any transactions made without their knowledge will be halted since it will require the owners permission.</p>
